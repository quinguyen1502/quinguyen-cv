                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Focus & Scalability:</strong> The platform's initial strong focus on HR and task management limited its seamless expansion into other business domains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture & Documentation:</strong> Rapid MVP development led to a lack of comprehensive documentation and an initial architecture not fully prepared for large-scale expansion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Resources:</strong> The initial team was lean, primarily Dev and QC, lacking key roles like Scrum Master, PO, and BA to support a full development life-cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>UI/UX:</strong> User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) had room for improvement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Understanding:</strong> Limited initial understanding and clear direction for the No-Code Platform concept; primarily grew and adapted through continuous learning.</li>
                </ul>
